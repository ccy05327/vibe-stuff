1. **b) larrikin** \- While all options are similar, "larrikin" specifically captures the Australian archetype of a mischievous but good-hearted person who is a bit loud and rowdy. It's more nuanced than just "loudmouth".  
2. **c) knackered** \- This is a very common and natural-sounding slang term for "exhausted" in Australia and the UK. While the other options are correct English, "knackered" is the most idiomatic choice for C1/C2 proficiency.  
3. **b) sweet** \- In this context, "it'll be sweet" is a very common Australian colloquialism meaning "it will be okay" or "everything will work out fine". It implies a sense of reassurance.  
4. **c) cruisy** \- "Cruisy" perfectly describes a relaxed, easy-going, and low-effort event. It's a step more informal and specific than "casual" or "relaxed".  
5. **c) dodgy** \- "Dodgy" implies not just poor quality, but also that it's unreliable, questionable, and perhaps even slightly deceptive. It's a stronger and more specific criticism than "terrible" or "poor".

## Section 2: Listening Comprehension

**Instructions:** Listen to the following conversation, then answer the questions based on the speakers' tone and what is implied, not just what is said directly.

**Audio Script:**

**(Sound of cafe background noise)**

**Chloe:** "Oh, hey Liam. Fancy seeing you here. Thought you'd be chained to your desk."

**Liam:** (Sighs) "Yeah, right. Nah, Sharon's let me out for good behaviour. Just grabbing a long black before the 2pm meeting. You know the one."

**Chloe:** "Don't remind me. Another 'synergy session'. Reckon it'll be another all-talk, no-action affair?"

**Liam:** "Is the sky blue? Still, gotta show your face. Anyway, I was gonna shoot you a message. A few of us are heading down the coast this weekend, just to get away from it all. Bit of a last-minute thing. You keen?"

**Chloe:** "Oh, that sounds brilliant. But this weekend's a bit of a write-off for me. My brother's flying in from Perth. Another time, maybe?"

**Liam:** "Ah, fair enough. Family first. Well, the offer stands if he cancels on you for some reason. Catch ya."

**Questions:**

1. What is Liam's attitude towards his work meeting?  
   a) He is excited and looking forward to it.  
   b) He is stressed but optimistic about the outcome.  
   c) He is cynical and feels it's a pointless obligation.  
   d) He is indifferent and hasn't thought much about it.  
2. How does Chloe likely feel about missing the trip to the coast?  
   a) Relieved, as she didn't want to go anyway.  
   b) Genuinely disappointed, as she would have liked to join.  
   c) Indifferent, as she has other plans she prefers.  
   d) Annoyed at her brother for visiting.  
3. What does Liam's phrase "fair enough" primarily convey?  
   a) He thinks Chloe's reason is just and equitable.  
   b) He is formally acknowledging her statement.  
   c) He is expressing frustration that she can't come.  
   d) He is showing casual understanding and acceptance of her situation.

1. **c) He is cynical and feels it's a pointless obligation.** His sigh, the phrase "you know the one," and his rhetorical question "Is the sky blue?" in response to Chloe's cynicism all strongly imply he sees the meeting as a formality he must endure, not something productive.  
2. **b) Genuinely disappointed, as she would have liked to join.** Her response "Oh, that sounds brilliant" has an enthusiastic tone, and "this weekend's a bit of a write-off" suggests she sees her prior commitment as an unfortunate obstacle.  
3. **d) He is showing casual understanding and acceptance of her situation.** "Fair enough" is a very common Australian response that signals "I understand your reason and I accept it without any issue." It's a low-key, friendly acknowledgement.

## Section 3: Written Response

**Instructions:** Read the following scenario and write a short, informal email or text message in response. Aim for a natural, conversational tone.

**Scenario:**

You get the following text message from your Australian friend, Alex, who you were supposed to meet for coffee this afternoon.

"Hey mate, so sorry but I'm gonna have to bail on coffee this arvo. My manager just dropped a massive report on my desk that has to be done by tomorrow morning. Absolutely spewing. Raincheck?"

**Your Task:**

Write a reply to Alex. Your message should:

* Acknowledge his situation.  
* Show empathy or understanding.  
* Agree to reschedule.  
* Maintain a friendly and informal tone.

Notes for a good response:  
A strong response would use similarly informal language (e.g., "No worries," "All good"), show empathy for his work situation (e.g., "That sounds rough," "Classic move from a manager"), and suggest a new time or leave it open-ended (e.g., "For sure, let me know when you're free," "How's Thursday?").
